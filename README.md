# lpvDS-lib
This package provides a C++ library for execution of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) Dynamical Systems; i.e. GMM-based LPV-DS which have been used and introduced in [1,2,3]. 

This version of the LPV library focuses on the formulation proposed in [3] where a non-linear DS formulated as:

is learned from demonstrations in a decoupled manner. Where the GMM parameters used to parametrize 

while ensuring global asymptotic stability via constraints derived from either a:
- QLF (Quadratic Lyapunov Function): <img src="https://github.com/nbfigueroa/LPV/blob/nadia/img/stab_qlf.gif">
- P-QLF(Parametrized QLF):  <img src="https://github.com/nbfigueroa/LPV/blob/nadia/img/stab_pqlf.gif">

This formulation, together with the learning approach proposed in [3], enables the accurate encoding of highly non-linear, non-monotic trajectories, as the ones below:

while ensuring global asymptotic stability. To learn DS with this formulation and with any of the two Lyapunov constraints defined above go to the [ds-opt](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/ds-opt) package.

### Installation (Catkin package)
By following these instructions, we assume you have a ROS environment and use catkin workspace to compile code. 
Clone this respository in your ```./src``` folder and make sure that you have the [eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library. Then, compile the package
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
```
## Usage
First and foremost, one must have a GMM-based LPV-DS model, which requires the following parameters:
- GMM parameters: ``Priors``, ``Mu``,``Sigma``
- DS parameters:  ``A_k``,``b_k``

The ``lpvDS`` class can read these parameters in different formats:
- Text files: A text file of each parameter is needed.
- Yaml file: A single yaml file with all the parameters in single vector format.

Examples of these files are provided in the ``models/`` folder. To generate these files follow the ``demo_learn_lpvDS.m`` script in the [ds-opt](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/ds-opt) package. Once you have your lpv-DS model, you can either initialize an instance of the lpv-DS class as follows:

- For text file:
```
lpvDS.initialize(int K,int M);
lpvDS.initialize_A(const char *path_A_);
lpvDS.initialize_b(const char *path_b_);
lpvDS.initialize_gamma(const char *path_prior_,const char *path_mu_,const char *path_sigma_);
```
Where ``K`` is the number of the Gaussian components and ``M`` is the dimension of the system.

- For Yaml file: We assume that a Yaml file has been read via the ROS parameter server and each parameters is of ``std::vector<double>`` format

```
lpvDS.initialize(int K,int M);
lpvDS.initialize_A(std::vector<double> *A_);
lpvDS.initialize_b(std::vector<double> *b_);
lpvDS.initialize_gamma(std::vector<double> *Priors_, std::vector<double> *Mu_ ,std::vector<double> *Sigma_);
```

... continue modifying!
### In the loop:
```
LPV.Calculate_A(VectorXd X)
```

# How to run GMM (without LPV!)

By initializing the LPV system, a GMM is aoutomatically constracted.

### Initialization:
```
GMM.initialize(int Num_Com,int Num_state);
```
Num_Com is the number of the components and 
Num_state is the dimension of the system
```
GMM.initialize_GMM(const char  *path_prior_,const char  *path_mu_,const char  *path_sigma_,const char *path_threshold);
```

### In the loop:
```
GMM.PDF(VectorXd X)
```

---
### Testing the class
You can try the testing script as well, this was generated by compiling the library,  type the following:
```
rosrun lpvDS_lib test_lpvDS
```
This test will load a stored lpv-DS model (the one that generates the C-Shape above) and the demonstrations that were used to traine it. It will check for numerical errors in the estimated velocities, you should see the following:
```
bla bla bla..
