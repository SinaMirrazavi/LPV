# LPV
This package provides a C++ library for evaluation of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) Dynamical Systems; i.e. GMM-based LPV-DS which have been used and introduced in [1,2,3]. 

This version of the LPV library focuses on the formulation proposed in [3] where a non-linear DS formulated as:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/nbfigueroa/LPV/blob/nadia/img/f_x.gif"></>
  
is learned from demonstrations while ensuring global aymptotic stability derived from either a:
- QLF (Quadratic Lyapunov Function): <img src="https://github.com/nbfigueroa/LPV/blob/nadia/img/stab_qlf.gif">
- P-QLF(Parametrized QLF):  <img src="https://github.com/nbfigueroa/LPV/blob/nadia/img/stab_pqlf.gif">

Such formulation and learning approach, proposed in [3], enables the accurate encoding of highly non-linear, non-monotic trajectories, as the ones below:


while ensuring global asymptotic stability. To learn DS with this formulation and with any of the two Lyapunov constraints defined above go to the [ds-opt](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/ds-opt) package.

### Installation (Catkin package)
These instrutions are assuming you have a ROS environment and use catkin workspace to compile code. 
Clone this respository in your ```./src``` folder and make sure that you have the [eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library. Then, compile the package
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
```
## Usage
First and foremost, one must have a GMM-based LPV-DS model, which requires the following parameters:
- GMM parameters: ``Priors``, ``Mu``,``Sigma``
- DS parameters:  ``
in the format requested by ```svm_grad``` class, this can be generated with the ```writeSVMGradModel.m``` function in the matlab folder, then:
```
SVMGrad svm_(modelFilename);
x = load vector...              // Could Eigen::VectorXd or arma::vec<double> format
svm_.preComputeKernel(true);    // For fast derivative computation
gamma       = svm_.calculateGamma(x);
gamma_grad  = svm_.calculateGammaDerivative(x);
```
You can try the testing script as well, this was generated by compiling the library,  type the following:
```
rosrun svm_grad test_svmgrad
```
This test will load a stored svm-model (the one generating the figure above) and a testing dataset. It will check for numerical errors and output average function computation time for [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) inputs as well as [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) inputs:
```
SVM Model: /home/nbfigueroa/dev/catkin_ws/src/SVMGrad/matlab/models/2d-example2-svm.txt
model.D: 2
model.nSV: 40
model.b: -0.962694
model.sigma: 0.1

# How to run LPV

By initializing the LPV system, a GMM is aoutomatically constracted.

### Initialization:
```
LPV.initialize(int Num_Com,int Num_state);
```
Num_Com is the number of the components and 
Num_state is the dimension of the system
```
LPV.initialize_A(const char *path_);
LPV.initialize_theta(const char *path_prior_,const char *path_mu_,const char *path_sigma_);
```

### In the loop:
```
LPV.Calculate_A(VectorXd X)
```

# How to run GMM (without LPV!)

By initializing the LPV system, a GMM is aoutomatically constracted.

### Initialization:http://lasa.epfl.ch/people/member.php?SCIPER=233855
```
GMM.initialize(int Num_Com,int Num_state);
```
Num_Com is the number of the components and 
Num_state is the dimension of the system
```
GMM.initialize_GMM(const char  *path_prior_,const char  *path_mu_,const char  *path_sigma_,const char *path_threshold);
```

### In the loop:
```
GMM.PDF(VectorXd X)
```
